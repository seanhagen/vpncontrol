# vpncontrol

This is an app I built that can control the VPN clients configured in a Tomato-based router.

My goal is that this will end up being a stand-alone app that presents a web interface super simple. I wanted something that would let my girlfriend turn the VPN on/off ( mostly for Netflix purposes ) without having to know how to deal with the Tomato web interface.

## Usage

FIXME: explanation

    $ java -jar vpncontrol-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
